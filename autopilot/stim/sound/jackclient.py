    The latest version of raspiOS (bullseye) causes a lot of problems with the Jack audio that we have not figured out a workaround for.

class JackClient(mp.Process):
    """
    Client that dumps frames of audio directly into a running jackd client.

    See the :meth:`.process` method to see how the client works in detail, but
    as a narrative overview:

    * The client interacts with a running jackd daemon, typically launched with :func:`.external.start_jackd`
      The jackd process is configured with the ``JACKDSTRING`` pref, which by default is built from other parameters
      like the ``FS`` sampling rate et al.
    * :class:`multiprocessing.Event` objects are used to synchronize state within the client,
      eg. the play event signals that the client should begin to pull frames from the sound queue
    * :class:`multiprocessing.Queue` objects are used to send samples to the client,
      specifically chunks samples with length ``BLOCKSIZE``
    * The general pattern of using both together is to load a queue with chunks of samples and then set the
      play event.
    * Jackd will call the ``process`` method repeatedly, within which this class will check the state
      of the event flags and pull from the appropriate queues to load the samples into jackd's audio buffer

    When first initialized, sets module level variables above, which are the public
    hooks to use the client. Within autopilot, the module-level variables are used, but
    if using the jackclient or sound system outside of a typical autopilot context, you can
    instantiate a JackClient and then pass it to sounds as ``jack_client``.

    Args:
        name (str): name of client, default "jack_client"
        outchannels (list): Optionally manually pass outchannels rather than getting
            from prefs. A list of integers corresponding to output channels to initialize.
            if ``None`` (default), get ``'OUTCHANNELS'`` from prefs
        play_q_size (int): Number of frames that can be buffered (with :meth:`~.sound.base.Jack_Sound.buffer` ) at a time
        disable_gc (bool): If ``True``, turn off garbage collection in the jack client process (experimental)

    Attributes:
        q (:class:`~.multiprocessing.Queue`): Queue that stores buffered frames of audio
        q_lock (:class:`~.multiprocessing.Lock`): Lock that manages access to the Queue
        play_evt (:class:`multiprocessing.Event`): Event used to trigger loading samples from `QUEUE`, ie. playing.
        stop_evt (:class:`multiprocessing.Event`): Event that is triggered on the end of buffered audio.
        quit_evt (:class:`multiprocessing.Event`): Event that causes the process to be terminated.
        client (:class:`jack.Client`): Client to interface with jackd
        blocksize (int): The blocksize - ie. samples processed per :meth:`.JackClient.process` call.
        fs (int): Sampling rate of client
        zero_arr (:class:`numpy.ndarray`): cached array of zeroes used to fill jackd pipe when not processing audio.
        continuous_cycle (:class:`itertools.cycle`): cycle of frames used for continuous sounds
        mono_output (bool): ``True`` or ``False`` depending on if the number of output channels is 1 or >1, respectively.
