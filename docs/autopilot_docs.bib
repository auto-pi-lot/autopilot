  abstract = {In this paper a sensor fusion algorithm is developed and implemented for detecting orientation in three dimensions. Tri-axis MEMS inertial sensors and tri-axis magnetometer outputs are used as input to the fusion system. A Kalman filter is designed to compensate the inertial sensors errors by combining accelerometer and gyroscope data. A tilt compensation unit is designed to calculate the heading of the system.},

  abstract = {The ability to control a behavioral task or stimulate neural activity based on animal behavior in real-time is an important tool for experimental neuroscientists. Ideally, such tools are noninvasive, low-latency, and provide interfaces to trigger external hardware based on posture. Recent advances in pose estimation with deep learning allows researchers to train deep neural networks to accurately quantify a wide variety of animal behaviors. Here, we provide a new DeepLabCut-Live! package that achieves low-latency real-time pose estimation (within 15 ms, {$>$}100 FPS), with an additional forward-prediction module that achieves zero-latency feedback, and a dynamic-cropping mode that allows for higher inference speeds. We also provide three options for using this tool with ease: (1) a stand-alone GUI (called DLC-Live! GUI), and integration into (2) Bonsai, and (3) AutoPilot. Lastly, we benchmarked performance on a wide range of systems so that experimentalists can easily decide what hardware is required for their needs.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a fusion method for combining outputs acquired by low-cost inertial measurement units and electronic magnetic compasses. Specifically, measurements of inertial accelerometer and gyroscope sensors are combined with no-inertial magnetometer sensor measurements to provide the optimal three-dimensional (3D) orientation of the sensors' axis systems in real time. The method combines Euler\textendash Cardan angles and rotation matrix for attitude and heading representation estimation and deals with the ``gimbal lock'' problem. The mathematical formulation of the method is based on Kalman filter and takes into account the computational cost required for operation on mobile devices as well as the characteristics of the low-cost microelectromechanical sensors. The method was implemented, debugged, and evaluated in a desktop software utility by using a low-cost sensor system, and it was tested in an augmented reality application on an Android mobile device, while its efficiency was evaluated experimentally.},

  abstract = {We prove that when a line is approximated using digital line, the error in the slope of the digital line has a definite upper bound and is strongly dependent on the two pixels chosen for defining the digital line. Thus, an analytical expression of the maximum deviation of the pixels from the digital line can be derived. Using this, the conventional line fitting methods that use maximum tolerable deviation as the optimization goal can be made control-parameter independent. This error bound can be used to make the most recent and sophisticated line fitting methods parameter independent and more robust to digitization noises. In our knowledge, this is the first line fitting method completely devoid of any control parameter. Such control-parameter independent line fitting algorithm retains the characteristics of the digital curve with sufficient reliability and precision and provides good dimensionality reduction in representing the digital curves. Extensive results have been generated for 9 datasets comprising of about a hundred thousand images. The proposed method shows robust and repeatable performance across all the datasets with low standard deviation in the performance.},
