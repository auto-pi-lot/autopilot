  abstract = {In this paper a sensor fusion algorithm is developed and implemented for detecting orientation in three dimensions. Tri-axis MEMS inertial sensors and tri-axis magnetometer outputs are used as input to the fusion system. A Kalman filter is designed to compensate the inertial sensors errors by combining accelerometer and gyroscope data. A tilt compensation unit is designed to calculate the heading of the system.},

  abstract = {The ability to control a behavioral task or stimulate neural activity based on animal behavior in real-time is an important tool for experimental neuroscientists. Ideally, such tools are noninvasive, low-latency, and provide interfaces to trigger external hardware based on posture. Recent advances in pose estimation with deep learning allows researchers to train deep neural networks to accurately quantify a wide variety of animal behaviors. Here, we provide a new DeepLabCut-Live! package that achieves low-latency real-time pose estimation (within 15 ms, {$>$}100 FPS), with an additional forward-prediction module that achieves zero-latency feedback, and a dynamic-cropping mode that allows for higher inference speeds. We also provide three options for using this tool with ease: (1) a stand-alone GUI (called DLC-Live! GUI), and integration into (2) Bonsai, and (3) AutoPilot. Lastly, we benchmarked performance on a wide range of systems so that experimentalists can easily decide what hardware is required for their needs.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a fusion method for combining outputs acquired by low-cost inertial measurement units and electronic magnetic compasses. Specifically, measurements of inertial accelerometer and gyroscope sensors are combined with no-inertial magnetometer sensor measurements to provide the optimal three-dimensional (3D) orientation of the sensors' axis systems in real time. The method combines Euler\textendash Cardan angles and rotation matrix for attitude and heading representation estimation and deals with the ``gimbal lock'' problem. The mathematical formulation of the method is based on Kalman filter and takes into account the computational cost required for operation on mobile devices as well as the characteristics of the low-cost microelectromechanical sensors. The method was implemented, debugged, and evaluated in a desktop software utility by using a low-cost sensor system, and it was tested in an augmented reality application on an Android mobile device, while its efficiency was evaluated experimentally.},

  abstract = {Previous work is extended by deriving an even more efficient implementation of the Gammatone filter bank, and by showing the MATLAB\texttrademark{} code to design and implement an ERB filter bank based on Gamm atone filters. This report describes an implementation of a cochlear model proposed by Roy Patterson [Patterson1992]. Like a previous report [Slaney1988], this document is an electronic notebook written using a software package called Mathematica\texttrademark{} [Wolfram 1988]. This report describes the filter bank and its implementation. The filter bank is designed as a set of parallel bandpass filters, each tuned to a different frequency. This report extends previous work by deriving an even more efficient implementation of the Gammatone filter bank, and by showing the MATLAB\texttrademark{} code to design and implement an ERB filter bank based on Gammatone filters.},
