Here 'opcode' refers to one byte that specifies a particular
command. See definitions at top of statemachine.ino and smclient.py

* CONNECT (establish connection):
- Client sends CONNECT opcode.
- Server checks for CONNECT opcode.
- Server sends OK opcode.
- Server starts main loop.
- Client checks for OK opcode.
- Client continues.

* TEST_CONNECTION:
- Client sends opcode.
- Server sends OK opcode.

* GET_SERVER_VERSION:
- Client sends opcode.
- Server sends a single line of text (a string with line-break).

* SET_SIZES:
- Client sends opcode.
- Client sends one byte with the number of inputs.
- Client sends one byte with the number of outputs.
- Client sends one byte with the number of extra timers.
- Server does not return anything.

* GET_TIME:
- Client sends opcode.
- Server sends the time as a single line of text (a string with line-break)

* GET_INPUTS:

- Server sends one byte with the number of inputs.
- Server sends one byte for each input with the corresponding value.

* FORCE_OUTPUT:
- Client sends opcode.
- Client sends outputIndex as one byte.
- Client sends outputValue as one byte.
- Server sets the output. It does not return anything.

* SET_STATE_MATRIX:
- Client sends opcode.
- Client sends each element of the matrix as one byte, one row at a time:
  (state0,action0) then (state0,action1) and so on.
- Server does not return anything.
- NOTE: currently, matrix is limited to 256x256

* REPORT_STATE_MATRIX:

* GET_EVENTS
- Client sends opcode.
- Server sends a string for each event containing:
  eventTime eventCode nextState (separated by spaces, terminated with '\n')
  . eventTime is sent in milliseconds
  . eventCode will be -1, if the transition was done through FORCE_STATE.
- The client has to read each line, split the values and convert to numbers.

* GET_CURRENT_STATE:
- Client sends opcode.

- The server updates the events table with the code -1 for a forced transition.

* ERROR:
- The server sends an ERROR opcode if the command was not recognized.



=== Events matrix ===
- Events' IDs are integers as follows:
  - TTL inputs: 0,1,2,3,... (nInputs-1)
  - State timer: nInputs
  - Extra timer: (nInputs+1),(nInputs+2),...
  - Forced event: -1


=== TIMERS' BEHAVIOR ===
There are two types of timers:

1. State timers: when the state machine enters a state, a timer for
   that state is started. The state transition matrix defines what to
   do when the timer goes off.
 - If there is a "null" transition to the same state, the timer is not
   reinitiated, but continues.
 - This timer is reset/forgotten when leaving that state.

2. Extra timers: these are additional timers that can be triggered
   when the state machine enters a state. Extra columns in the state
   transition matrix define what to do when each timer goes off.
 - If there is a "null" transition to the same state, the timer is not
   reinitiated, but continues.
 - These timers are remembered between states.
 - If the timer is running when entering again the triggering state,
   the timer is reset.
   

=== TO DO ===
- Check how much memory is being used:
  http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/AvailableMemory
- Test that nStates (in stateMatrix) is within limits (<256)


=== QUESTIONS ABOUT DESIGN ===
- What happens if a state-timer event makes a transition from a state to
  itself? does it appear in the matrix of transitions?
  ANSWER: Yes. In the example I run, it appear as eventCode 6.


=== DESIGN DECISIONS ==
- Millisecond precision:
  . Function millis() returns uint32 which overflows at 50 days.
  . Behavior rarely requires higher resolution
  . micros() would overflow after 70min, but we could modify it to
    return an uint64 instead.
- The client takes and returns time values in seconds.
- The server does not use interrupts (for timing or input events). This
  way it is easy to find out the order of steps by the server.
- If all events in the queue bring the state machine to the same state
  within a cycle, it will be as if nothing had happened. That is, outputs
  in intermediate states will not be set.
- Stopping the state machine does not turn off outputs. This may be a
  problem when using lasers and other pulsed outputs.
- When returning events, the server only sends the next state, not the
  previous state. Having next state and the previous event should be =
  enough for keeping track of transitions, unless events are skipped.




- Arrays for events and stateMatrix are created as globals with a
  predefined max size.
- Additional timers ... (not sure yet)
- Little endian for transmission. Arbitraty decision, let's say
  because x86 architecture uses it.
- Maximum number of states is 256 (to fit in one byte)
- Maximum number of events in one go depends on board memory,
  You need to use get_events() often to avoid overflow.

- When the state machine is not running it still reads the inputs, but
  it does not update the states.
- Outputs for each state are sent as one byte from which each bit is
  one output. This limits the number of outputs to 8.
- A stateTimer value of 0 means that the outputs for that state are set
  but the state will change right away on the next cycle.
- The time between finishing one trial and starting the next, depends on
  the updating time of the dispatcher. The client needs to check that a
  final state has been reached, and the server needs to receive the code
  that starts the new trial.

- XXFIXME:  Inputs are detected by external interrupts.
- XXFIXME: A timer for each state is implemented with a hardware timer and interrupt.

=== LIMITS (to improve) ===
- nEvents is limited at 256 by the way it is sent in GET_EVENTS
- stateMatrix is limited to 256x256
- If many events happen in 1ms (the resolution of the system) they will executed
  but if the system returns to the same state after all these, no outputs will
  change. See implementation in execute_cycle()

=== BUGS (server) ===
- Opcode 0x98 or 0x99 did not work on Maple (why?)
- The serial port has spurious data before requesting GET_INPUTS
  (or other commands)
  SOLUTION: I had to use self.ser.flushInput()
- 2012-08-07:  attachInterrupt(BOARD_BUTTON_PIN, log_event, CHANGE);
  seems to work only when removing the all 'case' statements.
  NOPE: I was missing 'break' statements in each 'case'.
- 2012-08-08: Serial port handle only 64bits at the time.
  http://forums.leaflabs.com/topic.php?id=659
  I need to split the stateMatrix.
  NOTE: when receiving the events data this does not seem to be a problem

- 2012-08-08: weird behavior after sending matrix, is as if the serialUSB
  gets stuck, and it doesn't reach the end of loop() where state machine
  is updated. (or interrupt not called?)

- 2012-08-16: random data in the SerialUSB when sending matrix and timers
  one after the other.
  SOLUTION: Using SerialUSB.available() before each read seems to solve the
  problem.

- 2012-08-17: after ~45sec of switching states with timers, the LED starts
  pulsing (throbing) and the Maple cannot be reset from software.
  And sending commands on the SerialUSB does not stop the problem.
  See http://leaflabs.com/docs/troubleshooting.html#id3
  SOLUTION: The problem was that there were more events than MAXNEVENTS,
            and the matrix of events had allocated only so many.
            You need to request events often to clear the matrix.


=== BUGS (client) ===
- When replacing a value (e.g., a NumericParam), the system will crash if the box if empty.
